  - Escalation policies
```

---

## 🟢 Low Priority (Continuous Improvement)

### 1. Documentation Gaps
```yaml
Issue: Missing runbooks, architecture docs
Impact: Low - Onboarding delays
Effort: Ongoing
Solution:
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Runbook templates
  - Video tutorials
  - Knowledge base
```

### 2. Testing Coverage
```yaml
Issue: No automated tests
Impact: Low - Quality assurance
Effort: Ongoing
Solution:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Load tests
  - Chaos engineering
```
